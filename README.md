# Coding Quiz
​
Man did I learn a lot on this one. I started out by storing my questions and answers in data-attributes in the html file. As I got further and further into it realized how much of a mistake that was. I quickly noticed just how hard it would be to update this quiz at a later time and would be a headache for myself or anyone else that would need to work on this.  I had to scrap almost all my work and start from scratch.  It then became very apparent how powerful array can be.  I could later come in and add more questions with ease and the ability to only change a few parts of my code.  I also learned how much more I could go beyond that and start storying the information in objects.  This was a great challenge.
